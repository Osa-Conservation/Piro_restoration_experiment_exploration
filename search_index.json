Also known as: The Piro Restoration Experiment The centralized document for the protocols used in this experiment lives here. Note, as this is a working document only OC staff currently have access. 1.1 Study area and survey locations The following map shows the locations of all the surveys included within this project to date, coloured by simplfied treatment category: active restoration; natural restoration and forest control. The number of survey locations for each category are as follows: Treatment Number of Locations active_restoration 30 forest 24 passive_restoration 10 1.2 Historical survey timeline NOTE We still need incorporate the vegetation data [Also - should we add historical dung beetle and butterfly data?] 1.3 Earthwatch survey timeline Now lets zoom in on data collected since our collaboration with Earthwatch started: And a summary of the number of different surveys conducted by year: Table 1.1: Table 1.2: Number of unique site-date surveys by type and year Survey Type 2017 2019 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Total Birds 117 95 105 0 0 0 152 0 469 Bats 0 0 0 200 240 240 239 19 938 Camera traps 0 0 0 0 0 0 155 0 155 Amphibians 120 121 124 56 0 0 68 0 489 Small mammals 0 0 0 0 0 0 19 0 19 Total 237 216 229 256 240 240 633 19 2070 "],["bird-surveys.html", "2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data 2.2 Historical", " 2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data Since January 2025, we have visited 42 unique survey locations and performed 152 point counts, and recorded 120 different species classifications.

These simple patterns in species richness do not reflect the complex species specific affinities birds have to the different habitat categories.

We could use grass cover a a proxy for how well the original treatments worked - i.e. if there is very high ground cover than would suggest the trees are not doing particularly well. I have explored the mean grass cover (number of quadrants which contain gress) as the metric for each location: Some sites have low grass cover, but it doesnt appear to be linked to the original restoration methodology (L,M,H, N). High seems to be the worst, and medium the best!
