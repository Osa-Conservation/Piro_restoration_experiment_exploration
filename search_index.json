Also known as: The Piro Restoration Experiment The centralized document for the protocols used in this experiment lives here. Note, as this is a working document only OC staff currently have access. 1.1 Study area and survey locations The following map shows the locations of all the surveys included within this project to date. 1.2 Historical survey timeline NOTE I still need access to the vegetation data [Also note - should we add dung beetle and butterflies] 1.3 Earthwatch survey timeline Now lets zoom in on data collected since our collaboration with Earthwatch started: "],["bird-surveys.html", "2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data 2.2 Historical", " 2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data So for we have visited 23 unique survey locations and performed 59 point counts, and recorded 73 different species classifications.

I have explored the mean grass cover (number of quadrants which contain gress) as the metric for each location: Some sites have low grass cover, but it doesnt appear to be linked to the original restoration methodology (L,M,H, N). High seems to be the worst, and medium the best! We can do the same but with leaf litter cover (in this instance higher values are better): And shrub cover - note higher values of this are no nessecarily good: Finally if we create a plot of grass vs. leaf litter, this should give us a good idea of where trees are coming back well: "],["small-mammal-data.html", "5 Small mammal data", " 5 Small mammal data "],["camera-trap-data.html", "6 Camera trap data", " 6 Camera trap data "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
