Also known as: The Piro Restoration Experiment The centralized document for the protocols used in this experiment lives here. Note, as this is a working document only OC staff currently have access. 1.1 Study area and survey locations The following map shows the locations of all the surveys included within this project to date. 1.2 Historical survey timeline NOTE We still need incorporate the vegetation data [Also - should we add historical dung beetle and butterfly data?] 1.3 Earthwatch survey timeline Now lets zoom in on data collected since our collaboration with Earthwatch started: "],["bird-surveys.html", "2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data 2.2 Historical", " 2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data Since January 2025, we have visited 33 unique survey locations and performed 86 point counts, and recorded 99 different species classifications. The distribution of survey effort is as follows: The distributions of species detected is as follows: 2.2 Historical Since the start of the project we have visited 40 unique survey locations and performed 403 point counts, and recorded 153 different species classifications. The survey effort (number of locations samples and number of point counts by year) are as follows: Table 2.1: Bird survey effort through time year plots_visited total_point_counts 2017 40 117 2019 38 95 2021 38 105 2025 35 86 The frequency distributions of the species detected are as follows: "],["bat-data.html", "3 Bat data 3.1 Survey effort through time 3.2 Overall bat occupancy through time 3.3 Treatment specific occupancy through time", " 3 Bat data We have been collecting bat data from 20 bat boxes, and visited these locations 42 times. They are distributed as follows: 3.1 Survey effort through time 3.2 Overall bat occupancy through time To understand the long term patterns in bat use of the nest boxes, we can look at the probability of a bat occupying the boxes or not through time: 3.3 Treatment specific occupancy through time "],["small-mammal-data.html", "4 Small mammal data", " 4 Small mammal data So far we have made 76 sherman trap deployments, across 19 plots. The deployments we distributed as follows: Top date we have recorded 6 small mammals. They are as follows: species count Handleomys 1 Heteromys desmarestianus 1 Marmosa mexicana 1 Oligoryzomys costaricensis 1 Transandinomys talamancae 2 Of these, 4 were in forest and 2 were in the plots.

We could use grass cover a a proxy for how well the original treatments worked - i.e. if there is very high ground cover than would suggest the trees are not doing particularly well. I have explored the mean grass cover (number of quadrants which contain gress) as the metric for each location: Some sites have low grass cover, but it doesnt appear to be linked to the original restoration methodology (L,M,H, N). High seems to be the worst, and medium the best! We can do the same but with leaf litter cover (in this instance higher values are better): And shrub cover - note higher values of this are not necessarily good: Canopy cover Finally if we create a plot of grass vs. leaf litter, this should give us a good idea of where trees are coming back well: "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
