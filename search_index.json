Also known as: The Piro Restoration Experiment The centralized document for the protocols used in this experiment lives here. Note, as this is a working document only OC staff currently have access. 1.1 Study area and survey locations The following map shows the locations of all the surveys included within this project to date. 1.2 Historical survey timeline NOTE I still need access to the vegetation data [Also note - should we add dung beetle and butterflies] 1.3 Earthwatch survey timeline Now lets zoom in on data collected since our collaboration with Earthwatch started: "],["bird-surveys.html", "2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data 2.2 Historical", " 2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data So for we have visited 23 unique survey locations and performed 59 point counts, and recorded 73 different species classifications. The distribution of survey effort is as follows: The distributions of species detected is as follows: 2.2 Historical Since the start of the project we have visited 40 unique survey locations and performed 376 point counts, and recorded 137 different species classifications.
