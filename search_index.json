The following represents the data exploration for the data collected during the collaboration between Osa Conservation and Earthwatch for the project entitled: A multi-taxa approach comparing the success of active tropical rainforest restoration with old-growth forest in Costa Rica. Also known as: The Piro Restoration Experiment 1.0.1 Study area and survey locations The following map shows the locations of all the surveys included withing this project. # # First, set a single categorical variable of interest from station covariates for summary graphs. If you do not have an appropriate category use &quot;project_id&quot;. # category &lt;- &quot;feature_type&quot; # # # We first convert this category to a factor with discrete levels # dep[,category] &lt;- factor(dep[,category]) # # then use the turbo() function to assign each level a color # col.cat &lt;- turbo(length(levels(dep[,category]))) # # then we apply it to the dataframe # dep$colours &lt;- col.cat[dep[,category]] m &lt;- leaflet() %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group=&quot;Satellite&quot;) %&gt;% addTiles(group=&quot;Base&quot;) %&gt;% # Include a basemap option too addPolylines(data = trails, group = &quot;trails&quot;, color=&quot;brown&quot;) %&gt;% addPolygons(data=plots, popup=plots$plot_id, group=&quot;plots&quot;) %&gt;% addCircleMarkers(lng=locs_db$longitude, lat=locs_db$latitude, # Co lour the markers depending on the &#39;feature type&#39; #color=dep$colours, # Add a popup of the placename and feature_type together popup=paste(locs_db$plot_id, locs_db$original_treatment, &quot;&lt;br&gt;Long:&quot;,locs_db$longitude, &quot;&lt;br&gt;Lat:&quot;,locs_db$latitude), group=&quot;survey_locs&quot;) %&gt;% ## Add a legend explaining what is going on # addLegend(&quot;topleft&quot;, colors = col.cat, labels = levels(dep[,category]), # title = category, # labFormat = labelFormat(prefix = &quot;$&quot;), # opacity = 1) %&gt;% # # add a layer control box to toggle between the layers addLayersControl( baseGroups = c(&quot;Base&quot;, &quot;Satellite&quot;), overlayGroups = c(&quot;plots&quot;,&quot;trails&quot;, &quot;survey_locs&quot;), options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE) ) %&gt;% addFullscreenControl() m 1.0.2 Survey timeline "],["bird-data.html", "2 Bird data", " 2 Bird data "],["bat-data.html", "3 Bat data", " 3 Bat data "],["small-mammal-data.html", "4 Small mammal data", " 4 Small mammal data "],["camera-trap-data.html", "5 Camera trap data", " 5 Camera trap data "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
