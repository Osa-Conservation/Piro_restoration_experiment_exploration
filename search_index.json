Also known as: The Piro Restoration Experiment The centralized document for the protocols used in this experiment lives here. Note, as this is a working document only OC staff currently have access. 1.1 Study area and survey locations The following map shows the locations of all the surveys included within this project to date, coloured by simplfied treatment category: active restoration; natural restoration and forest control. The number of survey locations for each category are as follows: Treatment Number of Locations active_restoration 30 forest 24 passive_restoration 10 1.2 Historical survey timeline NOTE We still need incorporate the vegetation data [Also - should we add historical dung beetle and butterfly data?] 1.3 Earthwatch survey timeline Now lets zoom in on data collected since our collaboration with Earthwatch started: And a summary of the number of different surveys conducted by year: Table 1.1: Table 1.2: Number of unique site-date surveys by type and year Survey Type 2017 2019 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Total Birds 117 95 105 0 0 0 152 469 Bats 0 0 0 200 240 240 239 919 Camera traps 0 0 0 0 0 0 155 155 Amphibians 120 121 124 56 0 0 68 489 Small mammals 0 0 0 0 0 0 19 19 Total 237 216 229 256 240 240 633 2051 "],["bird-surveys.html", "2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data 2.2 Historical", " 2 Bird surveys 2.1 Earthwatch data Since January 2025, we have visited 42 unique survey locations and performed 152 point counts, and recorded 120 different species classifications. The mean number of visits was 3, minimum = 0 max = 6. The distribution of survey effort is as follows: The distributions of species detected is as follows: We can examine the average observed species richness per visits for the simplified treatment categories. These simple patterns in species richness do not reflect the complex species specific affinities birds have to the different habitat categories. Examining how frequently the top 20 most frequently detected birds were detected in each survey category reveals this: 2.2 Historical Since the start of the project we have visited 64 unique survey locations and performed 469 point counts, and recorded 162 different species classifications.

We could use grass cover a a proxy for how well the original treatments worked - i.e. if there is very high ground cover than would suggest the trees are not doing particularly well. I have explored the mean grass cover (number of quadrants which contain gress) as the metric for each location: Some sites have low grass cover, but it doesnt appear to be linked to the original restoration methodology (L,M,H, N). High seems to be the worst, and medium the best! We can do the same but with leaf litter cover (in this instance higher values are better): ## [1] &quot;plot_id&quot; &quot;location_type&quot; ## [3] &quot;original_treatment&quot; &quot;taxa&quot; ## [5] &quot;simple_treatment&quot; &quot;accessible_earthwatch_2025&quot; ## [7] &quot;status_2025&quot; &quot;geometry&quot; And shrub cover - note higher values of this are not necessarily good: Canopy cover 7.0.1 Prioritising sites Finally if we create a plot of grass vs. leaf litter, this should give us a good idea of where trees are coming back well: How do these sites relate to flooded areas? ## # A tibble: 6 × 14 ## plot_id latitude longitude date water_presence_0m ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 M07 8.41 -83.4 2025-08-05 00:00:00 0 ## 2 N01 8.41 -83.4 2025-08-06 00:00:00 0 ## 3 N01 8.41 -83.4 2025-08-06 00:00:00 0 ## 4 N01 8.41 -83.4 2025-08-06 00:00:00 0 ## 5 H10 8.40 -83.3 2025-08-05 00:00:00 0 ## 6 H10 8.40 -83.3 2025-08-05 00:00:00 0 ## # ℹ 9 more variables: water_presence_10m &lt;dbl&gt;, water_presence_20m &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # flooding_depth_0m &lt;dbl&gt;, flooding_depth_10m &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # flooding_depth_20m &lt;dbl&gt;, flooded_vegetation &lt;chr&gt;, earthranger_id &lt;lgl&gt;, ## # ...13 &lt;lgl&gt;, `22/11` &lt;lgl&gt; ## ## F01 F02 F03 F04 F05 F06 F07 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## F08 F09 F10 H01 H02 H03 H04 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## H05 H06 H07 H08 H09 H10 L01 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## L02 L03 L04 L05 L06 L07 L08 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## L09 L10 M01 M02 M03 M04 M05 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## M06 M07 M08 M09 M10 N01 N02 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## N03 N04 N05 N06 N07 N08 N09 ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## N10 P1_amphib P10_amphib P11_amphib P12_amphib P13_amphib P14_amphib ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## P2_amphib P3_amphib P4_amphib P5_amphib P6_amphib P7_amphib P8_amphib ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## P9_amphib ## 1 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
